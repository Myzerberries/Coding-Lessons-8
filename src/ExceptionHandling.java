public class ExceptionHandling {

    //An exception is an error that happens in code.
    //Some types of errors can be predicted and named.
    //Java has many named exceptions.

    //An exception is caught by creating a code block around the code, which might get the error.
    //This is done with the try statement code block.

    //The try statement has two code blocks.

    //The first is declared directly after the try keyword, and this code block ends, and is followed by the declaration
    //of the catch keyword.

    //The catch keyword includes the declaration of variables, in parentheses, and then has its own code block.

    //********************************************

    //See format for the try statement below:



//    try{
//        //statements that might get errors
//    } catch (Exception e){
 //       //code to 'handle' the exception
//    }
